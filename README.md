Prediction results of seven SOTA COD techniques and AINet, evaluated on example images from the Cotton Bollworm dataset. Successful matches between GT and predicted masks (white areas); False positive regions (red areas, over-segmentation); and false negative regions (green areas, miss-segmentation).

## CODE
Code for training and testing available at Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/code/hvelesaca/ainet 

The more qualitative mask results of AINet on Cotton Bollworm, Mango, and three benchmarks (CAMO, NC4K, COD10K) datasets have already been stored in Kaggle.  

The pretrained model is stored in Kaggle. After downloading, please put it in the pretrained_pvt folder.

Our well-trained models for Coton Bollworm, Mango, and Benchmark datasets are stored in Kaggle, which should be moved into the 'model_pth'.
