## [AIVGNet]()

The more qualitative results of HitNet on four benchmarks (CAMO, CHAMELEON, NC4K, COD10K) have already been stored in [Google Drive](). <br>

Our well-trained model is stored in [Google Drive](), which should be moved into the fold 'model_pth'. Google driver is out of service, please refer to [Huggingface]().If you have any question, please let me know!  For pretrained model, please use [Google Drive](). After downloading, please put it in the pretrained_pvt fold.
